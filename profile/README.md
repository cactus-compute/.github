## About Cactus

As AI becomes increasingly embedded in our daily lives, AI for phones, wearables, medical devices, cameras, drones will become personal. The models that use private data for context should run on-device without communicating with external servers. Cactus is a lightweight, high-performance framework for running AI models locally on mobile devices.

Cactus has unified and consistent APIs across:

- React/JS/TS for cross-platform apps 
- Flutter/Dart for cross-platform apps 
- C/C++ for core builds
- (Swift & Kotlin in dev)

We are redefining on-device AI with the following features:

- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Private phone tool use (camera control, gallery search, mail handling etc.)
- Multi-agent support and workflows on-device 
- Thinking mode & on-device reasoning 
- Hardware-aware models (both SOTA ports and foundation models) 

We're committed to keeping our core technology open-source, fostering a community where developers can collaborate to push the boundaries of what's possible with on-device AI.
